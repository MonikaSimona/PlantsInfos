            <p className="center">Hi everyone! I am Simona, and as you guessed i love plants. Here in my online garden I arranged some infos of my favourite plants. <br/> 
            I like the color green, and yeey all the plants have green part. Also the color violet is on the top of my color list, so you can spot some violet themed flowers in my garden.Plants make me think of growth, and that is important think in our lifes. They never stop growing. We can learn a valuable lesson, so my friends never give up and keep growing.
